# Blue Waters computing ReedMullerCode(2,6).TuttePolynomial()

[**Blue Waters**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Waters)
is a petascale supercomputer
at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
It is the fastest supercomputer at a university anywhere in the world.

The [64, 22, 16]-[Reed-Muller code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Muller_code),
also known as RM(2, 6), is the linear code over GF(2) generated by this matrix:
```python
[
  [ c&r==0 for c in range(64) ]
           for r in range(64) if bin(r).count('1') < 3
]
```
We compute its [Tutte polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte_polynomial)
and more general invariants on Blue Waters.

The full computation costs 2,000 node-hours.
We deliberately divide the computation into 48,520 subjobs so that
anyone can challenge our computation by rerunning only a subset of subjobs.
This makes our computation (economically) falsifiable.

See [how to challenge the computation](Challenge.md)
for more information.
