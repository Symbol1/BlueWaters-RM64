# Blue Waters computing ReedMullerCode(2,6).TuttePolynomial()

**Blue Waters** is a petascale supercomputer
at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
It is the fastest supercomputer at a university anywhere in the world.

The [64, 22, 16]-Reed-Muller code, also known as RM(2, 6),
is the linear code generated by the matrix over GF(2)

```python
[[c&ord(r)==0 for c in range(64)]for r in'@ABCDEFHIJLPQRTX`abdhp']
```

We compute its Tutte polynomial and more general invariants on Blue Waters.

The computation costs about 2,000 node-hours.
We divide the computation (not quite evenly) into about 48,520 subjobs.
All subjobs are feasible on descent laptops;
most of them costs less than 10 node-minuts.
Challengers are invited to double-check any subset of subjobs.
