# Blue Waters computing the Tutte Polynomial of ReedMullerCode(2, 6)

**[Blue Waters]** is a petascale supercomputer
at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
at the University of Illinois at Urbana--Champaign (UIUC).
It was the fastest supercomputer at a university anywhere in the world
until *TACC Frontera* came online in 2019.

The [64, 22, 16]-*[Reed-Muller code]*, also known as RM(2, 6), is
the linear code over GF(2) generated by this matrix expressed in python syntax:

```python
[
  [ c&r == 0 for c in range(64) ]
             for r in range(64) if bin(r).count('1') < 3
]
```

More precisely, it is generated by this matrix:

We compute its *[Tutte--Whitney polynomial]*
and more general invariants on Blue Waters.
See [the resulting polynomial](rm64tutte.txt) in matrix form.

For the general idea behind the computation,
visit [process overview](process.md) and links therein.
The full data set (modulo testing and log files etc)
is uploaded to my [Google Drive .edu account].

One can also [challenge the computation](challenge.md):
The full computation costs 2,000 node-hours.
We deliberately divide the computation into 48,520 subjobs so that
anyone can challenge our computation by rerunning only a subset of subjobs.
This makes our computation (economically) **[falsifiable]**.
